📊 Telecom Customer Churn Analysis – Power BI Dashboard

A complete data-driven churn analysis dashboard built in Power BI to analyze customer behavior, detect churn patterns, and identify business risks such as revenue loss, contract vulnerability, and customer tenure impact.

This dashboard highlights why customers leave, which segments are high risk, and how businesses can design effective retention strategies.

🚀 Project Overview

This project analyzes a telecom customer dataset to uncover key factors influencing churn.
The Power BI dashboard visualizes customer demographics, contract types, payment patterns, internet services, and revenue metrics to help reduce churn and improve customer retention.

📈 Key Metrics (KPIs)
KPI	Value
Churn Rate	27%
Total Customers	7,043
Active Customers	5,174
Churned Customers	1,869
Total Revenue	$456.12K
Lost Revenue	$139.13K
🔍 Insights Discovered
1️⃣ Tenure Matters

Customers in their first year churn the most.

Long-term customers show strong retention.

2️⃣ Contract Type Risk

Month-to-month contracts have the highest churn.

One-year and two-year contracts improve retention.

3️⃣ Payment Method Influence

Electronic check users churn significantly more.

Auto-pay methods reduce churn likelihood.

4️⃣ Revenue Impact

High churn results in major revenue leakage.

Early identification of at-risk customers helps prevent losses.
