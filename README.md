📊 Telecom Customer Churn Analysis – Power BI Dashboard

A complete data-driven churn analysis dashboard built in Power BI to analyze customer behavior, detect churn patterns, and identify business risks such as revenue loss, contract vulnerability, and customer tenure impact.

This dashboard reveals why customers leave, which segments are at risk, and how companies can design better retention strategies.

🚀 Project Overview

This project analyzes a telecom dataset to understand key factors influencing churn.
The dashboard visualizes customer demographics, contract types, payment methods, internet services, and revenue metrics to uncover insights that help businesses reduce churn.

📈 Key Metrics (KPIs)

Churn Rate: 27%

Total Customers: 7,043

Active Customers: 5,174

Churned Customers: 1,869

Total Revenue: $456.12K

Lost Revenue: $139.13K

🔍 Insights Discovered
1️⃣ Tenure Matters

Customers in their first year churn the most.

Longer-tenure customers show stronger loyalty.

2️⃣ Contract Type Risk

Month-to-month contracts have the highest churn.

Yearly and two-year contracts retain customers better.

3️⃣ Payment Method Influence

Electronic check users churn significantly more.

Auto-pay methods (credit card / bank transfer) lead to lower churn.

4️⃣ Revenue Impact

High churn creates major revenue leakage.

Identifying at-risk customers early can reduce losses.
